Recently I ordered a package that was to be delivered by ship, and unfortunately the tracking information they provided was rather lacking in detail, containing only information up to the point where it departed the facility to be boarded for shipping. Hence, I decided upon myself to track down where and when exactly the ship would arrive.
My first instinct was to obviously google search for any website and data that provided the location of ships.

I was happy to find that this was working pretty well, getting the information about all the ships that they had information on.

Now the one thing I found in common with these websites and was also the biggest obstruction to my quest was the annoying paywall they had setup if you wanted to gain access to their detailed information.

Fortunately there was this one amazing site who although did not have all the records available, they had 10 days of Port arrival and departure data available, and I instantly knew this was the one, the one site where I could uncover which ship my package was to be boarded on.
